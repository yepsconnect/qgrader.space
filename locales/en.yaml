description:
  acidity: "Acidity is evaluated based on intensity and quality. It should be sweet and pleasant."
  aftertaste: "Aftertaste, like flavor, is evaluated based on its cleanliness, duration, and complexity of descriptors. Ideally, the aftertaste should be no worse than the flavor."
  balance: "Balance is evaluated based on the overall impression of the coffee's harmony and complexity. For example, you should ensure that the coffee doesn’t have too much bitterness or acidity."
  body: "Body is evaluated based on density and quality. It should leave a pleasant tactile feeling in the mouth."
  fault: "Faults are unpleasant flavors in the cup. For example, earthy, moldy, grassy, woody, chemical, and other defects."
  flavor: "Flavor is evaluated based on richness and balance. Good coffee should have pronounced descriptors without harsh or unpleasant notes."
  fragrance: "Flavor and aroma are evaluated based on the purity and complexity of descriptors — those that can be detected in the coffee. They can be fruity, floral, herbal, spicy, nutty, and other types."
  taint: "Taint refers to minor defects in flavor that lower the overall score but do not make the coffee undrinkable."
  overall: "Overall impression is evaluated based on all the parameters: how the coffee looks, smells, and feels. It's important to consider all aspects to assess the coffee's overall quality."
